## Iris Flower Prediction

> Iris Flower Prediction using Machine Learning.
> In this project, our goal is to predict Iris flower species based on various features such as _sepal length, sepal width, petal length, petal width_. We will perform all steps from _Data collection to Model implementation_. During Model evaluation, we compare different machine learning algorithms based on the accuracy_score metric and find the best one. Then we create a web application using Django which is a micro python framework.
